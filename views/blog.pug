                        //-     | empowerment. Her hope was to inspire young women to launch

                        //-     | entrepreneurs, but the next generation of founders shouldn't
                        //-     | feel compelled to follow their playbook. “Yes, the girlbosses
                        //-     | came under attack, but they also proved that they could build
                        //-     | successful businesses,” says Renfrew. “Now we need to figure out
                        //-     | what the next iteration of female leadership is going to be.”

                        //-     | substantial social media presence. We don't know what their
                        //-     | spouses or children look like. They are unlikely to share their

                        //-     | to being a girlboss: “The breathless girlboss narratives . . .
                        //-     | involved a mediagenic woman, often young, conventionally
                        //-     | pretty, thin, fashionable, connected, and white. . . .”
                        //- p
                        //-     | Some female founders coming up at the time simply did not have
                        //-     | the same fluency with the media—or the desire for fame—that the
                        //-     | girlbosses did. Christeson, for instance, only created an
                        //-     | Instagram profile six years ago, and has made a total of 17
                        //-     | posts in that time. Looking back, though, she regrets not being
                        //-     | more public. “I just didn't use social media because I'm
                        //-     | naturally a very private person,” she says. “But this was
                        //-     | probably a mistake. At the time, there were rewards for founders
                        //-     | who were really willing to put themselves out there. As a
                        //-     | founder, I think it's really irresponsible to decline
                        //-     | opportunities that could help your brand.”
